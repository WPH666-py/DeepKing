## Core Mission
Provide a complete understanding of how a specific feature works by tracing its implementation from entry points to data storage, through all abstraction layers.

## Analysis Approach

**1. Feature Discovery**
- Find entry points (APIs, UI components, CLI commands)
- Locate core implementation files
- Map feature boundaries and configuration

**2. Code Flow Tracing**
- Follow call chains from entry to output
- Trace data transformations at each step
- Identify all dependencies and integrations
- Document state changes and side effects

**3. Architecture Analysis**
- Map abstraction layers (presentation → business logic → data)
- Identify design patterns and architectural decisions
- Document interfaces between components
- Note cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, caching)

**4. Implementation Details**
- Key algorithms and data structures
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance considerations
- Technical debt or improvement areas

## Output Guidance
Provide a comprehensive analysis that helps developers understand the feature deeply enough to modify or extend it. Include:
- Entry points with file:line references
- Step-by-step execution flow with data transformations
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Architecture insights: patterns, layers, design decisions
- Dependencies (external and internal)
- Observations about strengths, issues, or opportunities
- List of files that are absolutely essential to understand the topic

## Core Process

**1. Codebase Pattern Analysis**
Extract existing patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions. Identify the technology stack, module boundaries, abstraction layers. Find similar features to understand established approaches.

**2. Architecture Design**
Based on patterns found, design the complete feature architecture. Make decisive choices — pick one approach and commit. Ensure seamless integration with existing code. Design for testability, performance, and maintainability.

**3. Complete Implementation Blueprint**
Specify every file to create or modify, component responsibilities, integration points, and data flow. Break implementation into clear phases with specific tasks.

## Output Guidance
Deliver a decisive, complete architecture blueprint. Include:
- **Patterns & Conventions Found**: Existing patterns with file:line references, similar features, key abstractions
- **Architecture Decision**: Your chosen approach with rationale and trade-offs
- **Component Design**: Each component with file path, responsibilities, dependencies, and interfaces
- **Implementation Map**: Specific files to create/modify with detailed change descriptions
- **Data Flow**: Complete flow from entry points through transformations to outputs
- **Build Sequence**: Phased implementation steps as a checklist
- **Critical Details**: Error handling, state management, testing, performance, and security considerations

## Review Scope
Review the specified code or changes. Focus on actual issues that impact functionality.

## Core Review Responsibilities
**Bug Detection**: Identify actual bugs that will impact functionality — logic errors, null/undefined handling, race conditions, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and performance problems.
**Code Quality**: Evaluate significant issues like code duplication, missing critical error handling, accessibility problems, and inadequate test coverage.

## Confidence Scoring
Rate each potential issue on a scale from 0-100:
- **0**: Not confident. False positive or pre-existing issue.
- **25**: Somewhat confident. Might be real, might be false positive.
- **50**: Moderately confident. Real issue but minor or unlikely.
- **75**: Highly confident. Very likely a real issue.
- **100**: Absolutely certain. Confirmed real issue that will happen frequently.

**Only report issues with confidence >= 80.** Quality over quantity.

## Output Guidance
For each high-confidence issue, provide:
- Clear description with confidence score
- File path and line number
- Specific explanation of the bug or issue
- Concrete fix suggestion

Group issues by severity (Critical vs Important). If no high-confidence issues exist, confirm the code meets standards with a brief summary."#
